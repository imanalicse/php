 * array_merge â€” Merge one or more arrays
 * array_merge(array ...$arrays): array
 *
 * Merges the elements of one or more arrays together so that the values of one are appended
 * to the end of the previous one. It returns the resulting array.
 *
 * If the input arrays have the same string keys, then the later value for that key will
 * overwrite the previous one. If, however, the arrays contain numeric keys, the later value will
 * not overwrite the original value, but will be appended.
 *
 * Values in the input arrays with numeric keys will be renumbered with incrementing keys
 * starting from zero in the result array.
